        <p class="intro para">
            My relationship with Brijmohan  began in Jodhpur when my Father an Income Tax Commissioner had been transferred to Jodhpur and I joined the Jodhpur University for further studies in the M.Sc
(Physics)Department and got admission in First Year of the two Year Post Graduate Program. Our stay at Jodhpur was for a very short period but God had so arranged for us to meet each other. Our brief relationship at Jodhpur led us further to be tied into a Life long Friendship.Our initial story was very dramatic and stormy struggling to convince our Parents of our mutual affection for each other. Eventually alls well that ends well and we were tied in a strong bond of Marriage.
        </p>

        <p class="content-1 para">
            Our Journey ahead was at last blessed by our Parents Relatives and Friends.
        </p>

        <p class="content-2 para">
            We have been blessed with three blessed Children who have been the fountain of Love and Happiness of our Life. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="content-1 para">
            Neelima our eldest daughter was the bearer of Happy Tides of our Growing Family.A very blessed shy and loving darling she has always been the greatest strength of my initial years of a growing Family. A loving daughter an understanding Sister for our two children Jasmine and Hardik .
            Jasmine our second daughter is the bearer of fresh tides of our Family. Her birth brought new visions in our Life. The young boy Hardik was the bright Hope our complete Family Circle. Very much like His Great grandfather and Father he has been a great Scout in the True Sense. Having strong religious and spiritual foundation and simple values of Living and High Ideals of Thinking. Very loving and generous by Nature always ready to share her fortunes for the Family has a soft heart for the needy people. 
            Whereas Hardik has always been shy to boast about his achievements and very Social in his nature and maintaining relationships.
        </p>

        <p class="content-2 para">
            In My Spouse I have found a Great Scout an understanding and helpful Partner and a loving Father. 
His calmness and acceptance of any mishap has been his greatest assets. 
He was nicknamed Guddu as he was very good and accomplished to accept everything in his stride. My Brother Mukeshbhai gave him this nickname. His charm lies in his Character and Smiles. A simple young unassuming man he has been endowed with a strong religious foundation during his early childhood years. His memory was something which baffled me to the core of my Heart when I heard him reciting the entire Sunderkand of our Great Epic Ramayana.He has a very good knowledge of the Great Poets Kabir and Tulsidas.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion para">
            His excellent academic achievements paved his way for a bright challenging Career in Law.He has had the ability to face so many challenges of His varied Careers .His sharp intellect and ability to understand and problem have all helped us to face so many challenges of our strong Relationship of 49 Years. We look forward to God to bless us for many years Happy Years.
